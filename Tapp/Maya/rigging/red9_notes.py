    - MetaClass
        - method to get all attribudes, except mNode and nodeID?
        - connectChildren/connectChild
            - optional two-way connect? ability to just have message connection go into the .message of a node, and not two way connection between the attributes.
- how to get all meta children without specifics?
- optional ability to delete all downstream meta children. Know you have a workaround for it already:)
- getting this error sometimes, but when I restart Maya it stops occuring:
    # Error: line 1: TypeError: file C:\Users\tokejepsen\Documents\GitHub\Tapp\Tapp\Maya\rigging\meta.py line 191: super(type, obj): obj must be an instance or subtype of type #
