This tool helps to preview joint deformations by showing the arc of rotation with a sphere.

The tool creates a sphere and locator, which can be moved independently.
When moving the sphere or locator, the sphere radius changes to show the arc of rotation.

You can create the sphere from nothing, or select one or two object to start the process from.

When deleting the spheres the tool creates a joint with a null, from the sphere centre to the locator.
